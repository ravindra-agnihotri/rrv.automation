oops:

1. inheritance - virasat, papa ki property apne aap milti hai:
    a. inheritance karane ke liye extends naam ka word child class ke aapge lagate hai
    b. Single - Parent se Child
    c. Multilevel - Parent se Child se ChildOfChild
    d. Multiple - because it confuses java that which variable to take
    e. Hybrid - refer screenshot attached
2. Encapsulation - Getter , Setter
    encapsulation is having a private variable in my class(as it's a private, it cannot be called
    outside of class), accessing its value outside of class by the help of public getter and setter
    methods.

3. Polymorphism - Overriding, Overloading

    overloading- having a method with same name with diff parameters and maybe return type
    overriding-  having a method with same name and same parameter and same return type
    in my parent and child class
4. Abstraction - Interface, Abstract Class
